# PhaseJumpPro
Utility classes for making games with Unity.

# Documentation

The documentation very limited right now. It is a work in progress here: [Link](https://coinbump.github.io/PhaseJumpPro/)

# Modules

The code contains common design patterns for games in C#:

- Behavior Trees
- Basic objects for building node graphs/simulation graphs (for city builders, sims, etc.)
- Weighted randoms (Spawn/Loot Tables + Spawner2D with spawn radius)
- Common Shaders (Stencil, Desaturate, Invert, Single Color, RGB-Recolor, etc.)
- Directional Velocity (2D)
- Valves (for animated doors, switches, etc.)
- Interpolation curves
- Broadcast-Listener
- Command (for undo-redo)
- Timers
- ObservedValue
- Signal-Receptor (for tutorials)
- State Machines
- Bank for Currency (freemium apps)
- TopDown2D characters and basic steering (Flip, Wander, Wander-to-Target)
- Grid-Based Games (Bejeweled, Tetris, etc.)

# Special Effects
- FadeAnimation will fade from startAlpha to endAlpha

# Phase Jump Pro
Game Design Patterns common to all games.

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to establish a library of platform-neutral, language-neutral and engine-neutral design patterns for games. Originally written for Unity, the library has been re-thought and re-written in C++, currently with a Mac Xcode project called Kaiju.

## Mac Setup Instructions
- Clone the repository and submodules
- Open the SDL Xcode project and archive the framework. Copy the archived framework to `Library/Frameworks`
- Open the SDL_Image Xcode project and archive the framework. Copy the archived framework to `Library/Frameworks`

## Windows Setup Instructions
- TODO: create a CMake/Visual Studio project + setup instructions for Windows (on the todo list)

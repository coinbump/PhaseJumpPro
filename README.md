Some utility classes for making games with Unity

The code contains common design patterns for games in C#:

- Behavior Trees
- State Machines
- Weighted randoms
- Common Shaders (Stencil, Desaturate, Invert, Single Color, RGB-Recolor, etc.)
- 2D Movement paths (straight line)
- Directional Velocity (2D-Kinematic)
- Valves (for animated doors, switches, etc.)
- Interpolation curves
- Broadcast-Listener
- Command (for undo-redo)
- Timers
- ObservedValue
- Goals (for game goals (complete N tasks to continue))
- Signal-Receptor (for tutorials)
- Concept-Demo (for tutorials)
- Bank for Currency (freemium apps)
- TopDown2D characters and basic steering (Flip, Wander, Wander-to-Target)

# Editor Scripts

I created some scripts to make life easier for 2D Game developers:
- Grid Sprite Slicer
- XML Sprite Slicer
- Apply Pixel Art settings
- Generate Animation Clips from Spritesheets

The idea is to make prototyping simple games a bit easier by having some common design patterns in place.

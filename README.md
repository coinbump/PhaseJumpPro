# Phase Jump Pro
Game Design Patterns common to all games.

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to establish a library of platform-neutral, language-neutral and engine-neutral design patterns for games. Originally written for Unity, the library has been rethought and rewritten in C++.

The Unity code still works but it is using older code patterns and will need to be updated.
